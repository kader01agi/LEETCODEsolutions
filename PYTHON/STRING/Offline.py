345. Reverse Vowels of a String
Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.
The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "hello"
Output: "holle"
Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: "leotcede"

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consist of printable ASCII characters.

2000. Reverse Prefix of Word
Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.

For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
Return the resulting string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".
Example 2:

Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"
Output: "zxyxxe"
Explanation: The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".
Example 3:

Input: word = "abcd", ch = "z"
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: "z" does not exist in word.
You should not do any reverse operation, the resulting string is "abcd".
 

Constraints:
def reversePrefix(self, word: str, ch: str) -> str:
1 <= word.length <= 250
word consists of lowercase English letters.
ch is a lowercase English letter.

917. Reverse Only Letters
Given a string s, reverse the string according to the following rules:

All the characters that are not English letters remain in the same position.
All the English letters (lowercase or uppercase) should be reversed.
Return s after reversing it.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ab-cd"
Output: "dc-ba"
Example 2:

Input: s = "a-bC-dEf-ghIj"
Output: "j-Ih-gfE-dCba"
Example 3:

Input: s = "Test1ng-Leet=code-Q!"
Output: "Qedo1ct-eeLg=ntse-T!"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists of characters with ASCII values in the range [33, 122].
s does not contain '\"' or '\\'.

541. Reverse String II

Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"

1544. Make The String Great
Given a string s of lower and upper case English letters.

A good string is a string which doesn't have two adjacent characters s[i] and s[i + 1] where:

0 <= i <= s.length - 2
s[i] is a lower-case letter and s[i + 1] is the same letter but in upper-case or vice-versa.
To make the string good, you can choose two adjacent characters that make the string bad and remove them. You can keep doing this until the string becomes good.

Return the string after making it good. The answer is guaranteed to be unique under the given constraints.

Notice that an empty string is also good.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leEeetcode"
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: In the first step, either you choose i = 1 or i = 2, both will result "leEeetcode" to be reduced to "leetcode".
Example 2:

Input: s = "abBAcC"
Output: ""
Explanation: We have many possible scenarios, and all lead to the same answer. For example:
"abBAcC" --> "aAcC" --> "cC" --> ""
"abBAcC" --> "abBA" --> "aA" --> ""
Example 3:

Input: s = "s"
Output: "s"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s contains only lower and upper case English letters.
